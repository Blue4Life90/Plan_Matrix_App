To-Do List

[x] Complete cosmetic layout to Work Schedule
[x] Adaptive layout for smaller screens and reduced resolutions - potential avenues: adaptive layout, scrolling, zoom functionality, resizable widgets - chose horizontal scrolling
[ ] Add option for WorkScheduleLegend detachment
[x] Complete WorkScheduleLegend Frame
[x] Print Schedule - Began cosmetic overhaul of Print feature for overtime schedule; overtime schedule layout is nearly there with a few TODOs left; 
	Work Schedule no longer working with the new upgrades, will need to make some adjustments to accommodate the formatting adjustments with both schedules
	Need color formatting adjustments for overtime schedule layout as follows [working hours: green; asking hours: red; Names; staggered formatting] 
	Adjust header to accomodate HdrDateGrid info, thinking best approach would be to stack each character over the day using '\n'.
