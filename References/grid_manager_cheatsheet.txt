Sure, here's a brief outline of the parameters you can use with the grid geometry manager in Tkinter:

-row: 
The row of the grid where you want to place the widget. Rows are numbered starting from 0.

-column: 
The column of the grid where you want to place the widget. Columns are numbered starting from 0.

-sticky: Determines 
how the widget expands if there is extra space in the cell. It can be a combination of the characters n, s, e, and w, which stand for north, south, east, and west, respectively. For example, sticky='nsew' makes the widget expand in all directions.

-padx and pady: 
The amount of padding to add around the widget in the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) directions, respectively.

-ipadx and ipady: 
The amount of internal padding to add inside the widget in the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) directions, respectively.

-rowspan: 
The number of rows the widget should span in the grid. The default is 1.

-columnspan: 
The number of columns the widget should span in the grid. The default is 1.
