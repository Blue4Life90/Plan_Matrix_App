This application will have three access levels. A user can choose to login from TLSelectScheduleDate and their access will depend on their login information. Here is the breakdown of the Access Levels I intend to integrate for this schedule.

1. Read-only Access - The user will choose not to login using provided credentials and will click a button labeled "Read-only". The user will then be afforded access to the TLSelectScheduleDate combobox options to select the schedule they wish to view by selecting Crew name, Schedule month, and Schedule year. The schedule will open with the navigation pane (LeftPaneButtonFrame) hidden from view and inaccessible to toggle. All app widget states will be disabled. Most of the menu bar options will be disabled. The menu bar options available to a user at this access level will be File: "Select Schedule Date", File: "Select Schedule Type", File: "Exit", Help: "About, and Help: "Help".

2. Priviledged User Access - The user will choose to login using provided credentials and will click a button labeled "Login". The user will then be afforded access to the TLSelectScheduleDate combobox options to select the schedule they wish to view by selecting Crew name, Schedule month, and Schedule year. The schedule will open with the navigation pane (LeftPaneButtonFrame) and schedule information open and accessible to toggle. Most app widget states will be enabled though some buttons that have yet to be created will require higher access and will remain hidden. All of the menu bar options will be enabled.

3. Administrative Access - This is developer access. There will be absolutely no restrictions at this access level. The additional buttons available with this access level will be simply to view the logs and view associated workbook save files to make required changes when needed.
