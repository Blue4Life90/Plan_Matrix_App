The pack geometry manager in Tkinter has several optional parameters to control how the widget is packed inside its parent:

-side: 
Determines which side of the parent widget to pack the widget against. Can be TOP, BOTTOM, LEFT, or RIGHT. The default is TOP.

-fill: 
Determines whether the widget should expand to fill the space assigned to it. Can be NONE (the default), X (fill horizontally), Y (fill vertically), or BOTH (fill both horizontally and vertically).

-expand: 
If set to True, the widget expands to fill any extra space in the parent widget if the parent is resized. The default is False.

-anchor: 
Determines where the widget is placed if it doesn't fill the entire space. Can be any compass point (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or CENTER). The default is CENTER.

-padx and pady: 
The amount of padding to add around the widget in the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) directions, respectively.
