-bg or background: 
Sets the background color of the frame.

-bd or borderwidth: 
Sets the width of the border around the frame.

-cursor: 
Sets the type of the cursor when the mouse is over the frame.

-height and width: 
Sets the height and width of the frame in pixels.

-highlightbackground, highlightcolor, and highlightthickness: 
These options control the highlight that is shown when the frame has focus.

-relief: 
Sets the type of the border. It can be FLAT, SUNKEN, RAISED, GROOVE, or RIDGE.
